The Core program is new digital asset programs by Metaplex to deal with Assets on the Solana blockchain. Its main goal is to provide a easy to use, low cost program that contains a flexible plugin system.

Metaplex Core (“Core”) sheds the complexity and technical debt of previous standards and provides a clean and simple core spec for digital assets. This makes the bare minimum use case easy and understandable for users just starting out with Digital Assets.
