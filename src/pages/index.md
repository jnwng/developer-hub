The Metaplex Protocol is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain, designed to facilitate the creation, sale, and management of digital assets, primarily NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). It offers tools and standards for artists, creators, and brands to launch their own NFT projects and storefronts with minimal technical effort, enabling direct engagement with their audience. Metaplex aims to democratize access to digital commerce by providing a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly ecosystem for the NFT community.

In the list below, you can find and explore most of the programs and tools that are part of the Metaplex protocol and developer platform. We're excited to see what you build with Metaplex, if you have questions please reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/metaplex)!
